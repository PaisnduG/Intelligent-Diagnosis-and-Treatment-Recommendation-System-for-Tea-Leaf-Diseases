# Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation System for Tea Leaf Diseases using Image Classification and Document-based Question Answering


This project is a comprehensive system for analyzing tea leaves and identifying diseases. It consists of four modules:

1. **Intelligent Leaf Differentiation:** This module uses deep learning techniques to create a powerful classifier that can identify tea leaves with different diseases.
2. **Tea leaf preprocessing and segmentation using denoising autoencoder and semantic segmentation:** This module uses image processing and semantic segmentation techniques to accurately identify tea leaf diseases.
3. **Dual Classifier Module for Accurate Identification of Tea Leaf Diseases:** This module uses custom CNN and Xception models to enhance the accuracy of disease classification.
4. **Smart Medication and Prevention Suggestion System / Intelligent Disease Identification and Tea Domain Knowledge System:** This module uses BERT to ensure accurate knowledge-based disease detection and provide medication and prevention suggestions.
