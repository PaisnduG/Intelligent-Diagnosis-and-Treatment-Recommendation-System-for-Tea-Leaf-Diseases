        "Instead of looking at words in isolation, BERT, a transformer based model attempts to use the context of words to get embeddings. BERT uses several concepts of deep learning come up with a model that looks at context in a bidirectional fashion, leveraging information from the entire sentences as a whole through self-attention.\n",

        "Example: Suppose Question is \"How I can cross a road when their is no zebra crossing.\" and this question very similar to query \"How I can cross road on zebra crossing.\" and thier is a chance that above two method give wrong answers but could handle that question. And we don't remove stoping words in the document because if it remove word like in above example \"no\" meaning of whole sentance become change.
